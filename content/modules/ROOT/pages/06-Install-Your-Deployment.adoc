= Containerized AAP2 Installation

icon:clock-o[Duration: 15 Minutes] Duration: 15 minutes

Finally time to run the installer though the actual configuration steps in the prior two modules were quite relatively straightforward.

[NOTE]
====
This lab comes with two terminals so you can launch the installer in one terminal and keep an eye on the output whilst using the other to explore the processes and directory structures being deployed on the Containerized AAP2 host, reachable via `ssh aap2`

If you are swapping back and forth between the 2 terminals remember to ensure that both terminals have the `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH` set correctly.

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/home/devops/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.4-1-x86_64/collections

[Installation]
== Installation

. Ensure you are in the bundled installer directory
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd ~/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.4-1-x86_64
----

. Ensure your ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH is set correctly
+
[NOTE]
====
By default `ansible` would not be able to find the collections inside the bundled installer, hence the need to set this explicitly.
====
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/home/devops/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.4-1-x86_64/collections
----

. Run the installer

+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory \
    ansible.containerized_installer.install \
    -e GUID={guid}
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The final argument is unique to our configuration, as mentioned in the prior module. The `-e GUID={guid}` allows us to dereference the `GUID` var we used in our config-as-code Postinstall files. 
====
+

[TIP]
====
Occasionally at events like conferences network issues arise, and this can be unpredictable. If you have issues running the above command and losing the connection and in turn breaking the install you can use `tmux` as a workaround.

. Use `tmux` to create a tmux session which you can re-attach to.
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tmux new -t aap2
----

. You can re-attach to tmux via:
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tmux attach -t aap2
----
Hopefully, however, this scenario will not arise.

== Exploring the Installation Process

While the installer is running, keep an eye on it and you will see the flow of installation. Notice the `ansible.containerized_installer` collection is used for installation and can be explored from the installer directory `collections/ansible_collections/ansible`

. In parallel, use the other terminal to explore the installation, ssh onto the Containerized AAP2 host
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh aap2
----

. As the installation proceeds explore it with the following commands:
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tree -L 4 aap
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
aap
└── containers
    ├── podman
    ├── storage
    └── storage.conf
----
+

Containerized AAP2 Installer configures the above directory structure in the `ansible_user` account, in our case the `ec2-user`. In Production, it would be a good practice to create a dedicated service account for this purpose.

. Explore the `podman` configuration with `podman image ls` and later in the installer process `podman ps`
+

[NOTE]
====
Since we are running our install of Postgres you will *not* see it in the output of the above commands. Had we chosen to use the Containerized AAP2 version we would.

== Summary

We have now, hopefully, successfully run the deployer and installed Containerized AAP2 and connected it to the Postgres instance we installed earlier in Module 3.

The next module will guide us through an exploration of running a `job_template` on our new installation but feel free to explore the components:

[WARNING]
====
The current Tech Preview does *not* have inbuilt support for TLS, the following end-points whilst accessible will generate a Browser Warning. Until full support is added one possible workaround would be to terminate TLS on a reverse proxy such as traefik.
