In this, opening, module, we will explore the lab goals, our environment and introduce the Ansible Automation Containerized Platform and get ready to install the Containerized version of Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2, typically referred to as AAP2 from now on for brevity.

== Lab Goals

* Understand that this Lab is built around a TechPreview
* Understand the overall architecture and technologies of Ansible  
* Become familiar with different deployment options
* Install the Containerized version of AAP2
** Automation Hub
** Event Driven Automation
** Postgres
* Configure AAP2 Containerized via the Postinstall option
* Explore the AAP2 Containerized environment
** Storage 
** Logs
** Troubleshooting
